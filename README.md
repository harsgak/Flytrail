Track a fly navigating a maze.

## Intro
I have a video lying around from 3rd sem BioLab. Its a fly finding an exit through a 2D maze. 
The maze was mapped into regions with numbers alloted to each one.
In the class during the course we were asked to look at the fly video and note down the time when it crosses from a region into another. This was to be done until the fly exits the maze.

At the time I was fed up watching the video. Our fly took an hour crossing the maze. We had to spend a few hours on each video since the fly jumped sections sometimes. Also the map of regions was in a separate .jpg file, so we had to pause and look it up and then note down the crossings. This was a time consuming and boring excessive. 

At the time we had thought that a computer could be programmed to do this menial labor. Of-course at the time we didn't know anything of handling videos or even writing basic scripts. Over time this has changed. 

## Task
So todays hackathon:  
Task 1: WAP[write a program] to read the video and track the position of fly with time.  
Input: Video file  
Output: An array of tuple (t,x,y)  
Time Limit: 2h

Bonus Task 2: The region mapping jpg is also given. WAP to  
Input: Previous (t,x,y) output  
Output: An array of tuples strings "Section_i â€”> Section_j : t"
